* Magnetic Hunting Skills – Foxes can use Earth’s magnetic field to hunt. They often pounce on prey from the northeast, using the magnetic field as a targeting system!
* Cat-Like Behavior – Unlike most canines, foxes can retract their claws, have vertical-slit pupils like cats, and even purr when happy.
* Silent Steps – Foxes have fur-covered footpads that muffle their steps, allowing them to sneak up on prey with ninja-like silence.
* Communicative Tails – Foxes use their bushy tails (called "brushes") to communicate emotions, signal danger, and even cover their noses for warmth in winter.
* Over 40 Different Sounds – Foxes are incredibly vocal and can make an eerie scream, giggle-like chirps, and even sounds that resemble human laughter.
* Jumping Acrobatics – Some foxes, especially fennec foxes and red foxes, can leap over 10 feet in the air to catch prey or escape danger.
* Urban Tricksters – Foxes have adapted well to cities, where they sometimes steal shoes, dig secret stashes of food, and even ride on public transportation!
* Bioluminescent Fur? – Some species of foxes (like the Arctic fox) have been found to glow under UV light, though scientists are still studying why.
* Winter Fur Color Change – Arctic foxes change fur color with the seasons—white in winter for camouflage in the snow, and brown in summer to blend with the tundra.
* Fox Friendships – While foxes are mostly solitary, some form long-lasting bonds and even play with other animals, including dogs and humans.

* Give short responses of maximal 3 sentences.
* Do not include any newlines in the answer.

* Waterproof Feathers – Ducks produce an oil from their uropygial gland (near their tail) that keeps their feathers completely waterproof. Water just rolls right off!
* 360° Vision – Their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads, giving them nearly a full-circle field of vision. They can see behind them without turning their heads!
* Synchronized Sleeping – Ducks can sleep with one eye open and one side of their brain awake, allowing them to stay alert for predators while resting.
* Quack Echo Mystery – There’s an old myth that a duck’s quack doesn’t echo, but it actually does—just at a pitch and tone that makes it hard to notice.
* Feet That Don’t Feel Cold – Ducks’ feet have no nerves or blood vessels in the webbing, so they can stand on ice without feeling the cold.
* Egg-Dumping Behavior – Some female ducks practice "brood parasitism," laying eggs in another duck’s nest to have someone else raise their ducklings.
* Mimicry Skills – Some ducks, like the musk duck, can mimic human speech and other sounds, much like parrots!
* Built-In Goggles – Ducks have a third eyelid (nictitating membrane) that acts like swim goggles, allowing them to see underwater.
* Instant Dabbling – Many ducks are "dabblers," tipping their heads underwater while their butts stick up, searching for food without fully submerging.
